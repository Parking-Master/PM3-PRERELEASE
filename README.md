In 1 year.

Parking Master is (was) an old-fashioned Parking game. Starting from 1.0, where you park a square 2D block (the car) into the target lines (parking spot).<br>

Then, it went to Parking Master 2.0, which is the "Modern" version of 1.0, with all-new 3D web technology using WebGL and Three.js.

And now, 3.0, which is the latest version of Parking Master, is the latest and greatest one with 3D web technology at it's greatest, for free.
